Assignments and related course material completed by me as part of the 'Online Training: Mobile Robotics' from Dr. Cyril Stachniss

1. Implemented a recursive bayesian filter on a non-cyclic world. The probability histogram is attached below

2. Occupancy grid mapping algorithm was explored. A data file consisting of raw ranges and robot pose values was used. The raw values were converted into cell values of the grid cell by using bresenhams line algorithm and the map resolution was set as 0.25
